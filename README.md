## About Me

Passionate .NET Core Application Developer with a knack for building scalable, high-performance solutions. 
I turn coffee into clean, efficient code and bugs into learning opportunities. 

Strong expertise in C#, .NET Core, and modern software architectures, all while living by SOLID principles—because good code should be structured, maintainable, and not haunt you at night. 
Always eager to automate, optimize, and innovate—because life’s too short for slow apps and spaghetti code!
