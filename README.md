## About Me

Passionate .NET Core Application Developer with a knack for building scalable, high-performance solutions. 
I turn coffee into clean, efficient code and bugs into learning opportunities. 

Strong expertise in C#, .NET Core, and modern software architectures, all while living by SOLID principles—because good code should be structured, maintainable, and not haunt you at night. 
Always eager to automate, optimize, and innovate—because life’s too short for slow apps and spaghetti code!

## Projects

### GitHub Projects

- **[NLayer Generic Repository Template For ABC Company](https://github.com/bekirhankurt/ABC.NLayer.GenericRepository.Dotnet.9)**  
In .NET 9.0, I keep things straightforward by using a **Generic Repository Pattern** with *Entity Framework Core* to simplify data access, while the **Options Pattern with Autofac** keeps configuration neat and tidy. I rely on **Fluent Validation** to make sure inputs are just right, and I use **AOP** via *Castle* to slip in cross-cutting concerns like logging and caching (thanks to *Log4Net*) without cluttering the code. Plus, **JWT** ensures secure, hassle-free authentication, so every part of my app stays efficient and easy to maintain.



- **[A CQRS Template Project](https://github.com/bekirhankurt/NLayer.Template.Packages)**  
In .NET6.0, my generic package is built with a **CQRS** approach alongside a **Generic Repository** and the **Options Pattern** powered by *Entity Framework Core* to streamline data operations. I ensure data integrity with **Fluent Validation**, coordinate requests using **MediatR**, and handle email communications through **MailKit** and *MimeKit* within an *ASP.NET MVC Core* framework. For dynamic query capabilities, **Linq.Dynamic** comes in handy, while **JWT** secures authentication processes. Additionally, **NEST** integrates *ElasticSearch* seamlessly, **OTP.NET** provides robust one-time passcode functionality, and **Serilog** takes care of structured logging. Finally, with **AOP**, I easily weave in cross-cutting concerns, making this package a robust, scalable, and maintainable solution ready for reuse across projects.
